**CSS Intro**

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside a box and uses rules to indicate how each element looks.

- Selectors (that specify the element being affected) and declarations (that tell what each element should
  look like) make up the rules.

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element you want to change, and the values
  of those properties.

- CSS rules are usually put into a seperate document, but they can appear inside and HTML document.

**Color**

- There are three ways to specify color in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

- You can use a color picker to help find the colors you want.

- Make sure there is enough contrast between the text and the background color.

- CSS3 has a new extra value for RGB colors, known as RGBA, to indicate opacity.

- CSS3 also allows the use of HSL values to specify color, with an optional opacity value, called HSLA.
