# My Learning Journal for Code Fellows classes

**Introduction**

I'm Dave Wolfe. I've had a lot of different careers in my life and am finally ready to settle down and learn a solid skill. My most recent position was as an End-to-End software test engineer. I realized that there was a lot I didn't know, so I decided to learn coding. I'm very excited and ready to learn. This journal will be used to track my frowth and progress, as a developer.

**Growth Mindset**

My basic growth mindset is, "I will only continue to grow if I work hard and learn from my mistakes."
1. Mistakes are learning opportunities
2. Trying something completely different is a way to grow.
3. Keep challenging myself!
