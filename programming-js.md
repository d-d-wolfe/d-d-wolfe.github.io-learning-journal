**Programming With JavaScript**

- How JavaScript (JS) makes web pages more interactive

  - Access Content - Use JS to select any element, attribute or text from
    an HTML page.
  
  - Modify Content - Use JS to add elements, attributes, or text to the page
    or remove them.

  - Program Rules - Specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like
    a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.

  - React to Events - You can specify that a script should run when a 
    specific event has occurred.

**What is a Script and how do I write one**

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve
  a goal. Similar to a recipe, handbook, or a manual.

- To write a script, state your goal and list the tasks that need to be 
  completed in order to achieve it.

- Start with the big picture and break that down into smaller steps.

    - Define the goal.

    - Design the script.

    - Code each step.

- Create a flowchart showing everey step that needs to be accomplished.

- Computers solve tasks differently than humans, so we need to learn to 
  "think" like a computer.

**Expressions and Operators**

- Expressions result in a single value. There are basically two types of 
  expressions.

  - Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.

  - Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.

- Expressions rely on Operators; they allow programmers to create a single
  value from one or more values.
  - Arithmetic Operators such as +, -, /, *, ++, --, %.

  - String Operator - There is only one string operator; The + symbol. It
    is used to join the strings on either side of it.

**Functions**

- Functions allow you to group a series of statements together to perform a 
  specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you
  can reuse the function.

  - Declaring a function - To create a function, you give it a name and then
    write the statements needed to achieve its task inside curly braces. This
    is known as a function declaration.

  - Calling a function - Now that you've declare the function, you can 
    execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is known as calling the function.

  - Sometimes a fiunction needs specific information to perform its task. In
    such cases, when you declare the function you give it parameters. Inside
    the function, the parameters act like variables.

  - When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it
    should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or variables.
