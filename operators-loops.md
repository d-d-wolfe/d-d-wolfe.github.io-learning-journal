**Operators and Loops**

- Comparison Operators - You can evaluate a situation by comparing one
  value in the script to what you might expect it to do. The result 
  will be a Boolean: True or False.

- Logical Operators - Logical Operators allow you to compare the 
  results of more than one comparison operator.

- Loops - Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block
  will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still
  returns as true, the code block will run again. It will repeat until
  the condition returns false. There are three common types:
  
  - For - If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a 
    for loop.

  - While - If you do not know how many times the code should run,
    you can use a while loop.

  - Do While - The do...while loop is very similar to the while 
    loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.

- Loop Counters - A for loop uses a counter as a condition. This 
  instructs the code to run a specified number of times. The for loop is made up of three statements:

  - Initialization - Create a variable and set it to 0. This 
    variable is commonly called i, and it acts as the counter. 
    var i = 0

  - Condition - The loop should continue to run until the counter
    reaches a specified number. i < 10

  - Update - Every time the loop has run the statements in the 
    curly braces, it adds one to the counter. i++
