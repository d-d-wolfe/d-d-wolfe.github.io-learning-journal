**How Computers Work**

- Every computer has four things that they do: Input, Storage, Processing,
  and Output.

- Computers use binary to manipulate information. Every type of input is
  converted into simple binary commands.

- Binary code is basically just electrical impulses that the computer 
  translates.

- Computers use millions of tiny circuits to handle all of the binary code.

- The Operating System is the software that manages all of the other software
  on your computer, and manages what happens and when it happens.

- The hardware of a computer is what you can physically touch. Things like
  the keyboard, the actual computer and it's circuitry, the monitor, etc.
