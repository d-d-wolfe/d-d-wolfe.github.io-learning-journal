**HTML Basics**

*Process and Design*

- Decide who your target audience is, why they will come to your site, what they are looking for on your 
  site, and when they will visit again.

- Use a wireframe (a basic drawing of what the site should look like) to map out the high level design of
  the site.

- Create a sitemap to allow you to plan the structure.

- Designing a webpage is about communication. Showing "Visual Hierarchy" helps visitors understand what you
  are trying to communicate. In other words, areas that are larger or have a brighter color will draw the 
  visitor's eye to the things you want them to see first.

- Grouping and similarity help to simplify the information you are presenting.
