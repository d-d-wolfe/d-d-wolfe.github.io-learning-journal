**HTML Basics**

*Process and Design*

- Decide who your target audience is, why they will come to your site, what they are looking for on your 
  site, and when they will visit again.

- Use a wireframe (a basic drawing of what the site should look like) to map out the high level design of
  the site.

- Create a sitemap to allow you to plan the structure.

- Designing a webpage is about communication. Showing "Visual Hierarchy" helps visitors understand what you
  are trying to communicate. In other words, areas that are larger or have a brighter color will draw the 
  visitor's eye to the things you want them to see first.

- Grouping and similarity help to simplify the information you are presenting.

*Structure*

- HTML pages are basically text documents that use tags (characters inside angle brackets) to give special
  meaning to the information they surround.

- Tags are also known as elements.

- Usually there is an opening tag and a closing tag, which denote the beginning and end of a piece of content.

- You can place attributes with an opening tag. Attributes tell us more about what that element contains.

- Attributes require a name and a value (i.e.: height="150")

- It is important to know what tags are available and what they do and where they can go in the structure.

*HTML5 Layout*

- In previous versions of HTML we used multiple <div> elements. The new elements included in HTML5, which indicate the purpose of different parts of a webpage, allow for clearer code.

- Older browsers, like Internet Explorer 8 (and older), that don't understand HTML5, need to be told which 
  elements are block-level elements. Extra JavaScript is needed to make HTML5 elements work, and you can find that code, for free, on Google.

*Extra Markup*

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using

- You can add comments to your code, that won't show on the webpage, by using <!-- -->.

- the id and class elements are used to identify particular elements, and the div and span elements allow you
  to group block-line and inline elements together.

- To cut a window into your web page that displays another page you can use iframes.

- You can supply all kinds of information about your webpage by using the meta tag.

- If you need to include special characters, on your webpage, that aren't generally on a keyboard, you can use 
  escape characters like <, > and &#169;
