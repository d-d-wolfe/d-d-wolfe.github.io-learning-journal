# The Coder's Computer

**The text editor is one of the most important tools a developer uses.**

**Important Text Editor Features:**

- Code Completion - When you start typing something, *Code Competion* will give you a list of suggested terms.
- Syntax Highlighting - *Syntax Highlighting* will colorize your text. Attributes will be one color, Elements another color, etc.
- Themes - A variety of *Themes* in a text editor make it so you can personalize the editor to reduce eye strain and fatigue.
- Extensions - As you learn and grow, you will need your editor to grow with you. Downloading *Extensions* that do new things is how to
  accomplish this.

*Generally the software that comes with your computer doesn't have all of the functionality described above.*

**Third Party Text Editors**

There are a number of Third Party Text Editors. For me, it's important to find one that's free, and has all the options listed above. 
Here are some possible options for Windows Computers:
1. Notepad ++
1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
1. Atom

**IDE's (Integrated Development Environment)**

An IDE is basically a software suite that does more than a Text Editor. An IDE combines a text editor, a file manager, a compiler,
and a debugger all in one package.
