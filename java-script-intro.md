**JavaScript Intro**

- Although you can insert JavaScript directly into an HTML page, 
  it's best to keep your JavaScript code in it's own file. A 
  JavaScript file is a text file, just like HTML and CSS files, but
  it uses the .js extension.

- The <script> element is used in an HTML file to tell the browser
  to load the JavaScript file (just like the <link> element is used
  to load a CSS file).

- JavaScript does not change the HTML, because the script works with
  the model of the web page that the browser has created.

** Basic JavaScript Instructions**

- A script is a set of instructions, kind of like the steps in a 
  recipe.

- Scripts contain very precise instructions. Just like in a recipe,
  if you miss one instruction, the result will not be what you expected.

- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information that
  is used in the script.
