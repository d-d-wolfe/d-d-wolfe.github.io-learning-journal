# Notes about Markdown

**Basic Syntax**
1. Headings use the #. 
    ### More hashtags means smaller heading
1. There are a few different ways to style text, ** ** is **bold**, * * is *italic*, etc.
1. Quoting text is done by starting the quote with >. > This is quoted text.
1. Single backtics are used to quote code. `This is quoted code.`
1. You can imbed a link using [](). Here's a link to [Google](https://www.google.com)
1. I've created this as an ordered list, but you can also do unordered lists using a - at the beginning of each line.
    - Just
    - Like
    - This
This has been a fairly basic idea of what I've learned about **_Markdown_**
